*   **C.** _Web Pixels_ . To see how successful our marketing campaigns or other goals of the Services are performing we sometimes use conversion pixels, which fire a short line of code to tell us when you have clicked on a particular button or reached a particular page (e.g. a thank you page once you have completed the procedure for subscribing to one of our services or have completed one of our forms). We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
*   **D.** _Analytics_ . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services. Presently, we use **Google Analytics** . Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports Site traffic. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) . Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) .
*   If Google Analytics is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Site will provide you the opportunity to consent to Google Analytics and the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. We have implemented Google Analytics with the “AnonymizeIP” function, which makes sure that your IP address will be shortened before it is sent to servers in the U.S. Exceptionally, the shortening may take place after such transfer to the U.S. Google uses this data to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on activities on our online services and to provide us with other services related to Site, App and internet use.
*   **E.** _Behavioral Remarketing_ . We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services, e.g., by the duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the Google advertising network.
*   We use the following tools and services for these purposes:
*   *   **Google Ads** remarketing service is provided by Google. You can opt-out of this by visiting the Google Ads Settings page: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) .
    *   If Google Ads is structured to collect personal data, the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
    *   **Bing Ads** is a service operated by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland. Please read Microsoft’s privacy statement for more information on how Microsoft processes your information [https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) . When you access our Site via advertisements on Bing Ads, a cookie is set on your computer. In addition, a Universal Event Tracking tag is integrated on our Site. This is a code that, in combination with the cookie, stores data about the use of the Site, e.g. length of time spent on the Site, areas accessed, and ads used to reach the Site. In addition, Microsoft may track your usage patterns across multiple of your electronic devices through so-called cross-device tracking. The information collected is transferred to a Microsoft server in the United States. If Bing Ads is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Services will provide you the opportunity to consent to Bing Ads.
    *   **Facebook Ads.** Using [Facebook Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) , we may display interest-based ads to you when using Facebook. To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) in addition to the Your Choices section below. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our site, and Facebook matches the hashed data against its own users, generating a lookalike audience and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the “lookalike” audience, unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.
*   **F.** _Other Tracking Technologies_ . We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.
*   Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
*   **G.** _Do Not Track_ . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Site does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.
*   **H.** _Location Information_ . You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

9\. Social Media Accounts

We operate accounts and fan pages on different social media platforms (the **"Social Media Accounts"** ).

If you visit one of our Social Media Accounts you initiate a variety of data processing operations. Below we identify the other types of entities with whom you may interact when you visit one of our Social Media Accounts. If you do not provide us with your personal data, certain functionalities of the social networking platforms requiring such data will not be available to you or only to a limited extent.

As the owner of a Social Media Account, we can usually only see information stored in your public profile on such social media platform, and only insofar as you are logged in to your profile while visiting our Social Media Account. In addition, we may process data that you provide to us when you contact us through one of our Social Media Accounts (for example: if you create a post, or send us a private message via Facebook). If you visit one of our Social Media Accounts, the operator of the respective social network also processes your data, regardless of whether you yourself have a profile in the respective social network. The individual data processing operations and their scope differ depending on the operator.

*   **C.** _Web Pixels_ .

We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
*   **D.** _Analytics_ . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services. Presently, we use **Google Analytics** . Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports Site traffic. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) . Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) .
*   If Google Analytics is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Site will provide you the opportunity to consent to Google Analytics and the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. We have implemented Google Analytics with the “AnonymizeIP” function, which makes sure that your IP address will be shortened before it is sent to servers in the U.S. Exceptionally, the shortening may take place after such transfer to the U.S. Google uses this data to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on activities on our online services and to provide us with other services related to Site, App and internet use.
*   **E.** _Behavioral Remarketing_ . We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services, e.g., by the duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the Google advertising network.
*   We use the following tools and services for these purposes:
*   *   **Google Ads** remarketing service is provided by Google. You can opt-out of this by visiting the Google Ads Settings page: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) .

    *   **Bing Ads** is a service operated by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland. Please read Microsoft’s privacy statement for more information on how Microsoft processes your information [https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) . When you access our Site via advertisements on Bing Ads, a cookie is set on your computer. In addition, a Universal Event Tracking tag is integrated on our Site. This is a code that, in combination with the cookie, stores data about the use of the Site, e.g. length of time spent on the Site, areas accessed, and ads used to reach the Site. In addition, Microsoft may track your usage patterns across multiple of your electronic devices through so-called cross-device tracking. The information collected is transferred to a Microsoft server in the United States. If Bing Ads is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Services will provide you the opportunity to consent to Bing Ads.
    *   **Facebook Ads.** Using [Facebook Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) , we may display interest-based ads to you when using Facebook. To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) in addition to the Your Choices section below. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our site, and Facebook matches the hashed data against its own users, generating a lookalike audience and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the “lookalike” audience, unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.
*   **F.** _Other Tracking Technologies_ . We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.
*   Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
*   **G.** _Do Not Track_ . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Site does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.
*   **H.** _Location Information_ . You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

In addition, some operators of social networks (e.g. Facebook) use cookies that are stored on your terminal device when you visit our Social Media Account, even if you do not have your own profile in the network or are not logged in These cookies enable the respective operator to create user profiles based on your preferences and interests and to show you advertising tailored to these (within and outside of the respective social network)

We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
*   **D.** _Analytics_ . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services. Presently, we use **Google Analytics** .

*   If Google Analytics is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Site will provide you the opportunity to consent to Google Analytics and the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. We have implemented Google Analytics with the “AnonymizeIP” function, which makes sure that your IP address will be shortened before it is sent to servers in the U.S. Exceptionally, the shortening may take place after such transfer to the U.S. Google uses this data to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on activities on our online services and to provide us with other services related to Site, App and internet use.
*   **E.** _Behavioral Remarketing_ . We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services, e.g., by the duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the Google advertising network.
*   We use the following tools and services for these purposes:
*   *   **Google Ads** remarketing service is provided by Google. You can opt-out of this by visiting the Google Ads Settings page: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) .

In addition, Microsoft may track your usage patterns across multiple of your electronic devices through so-called cross-device tracking. The information collected is transferred to a Microsoft server in the United States. If Bing Ads is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Services will provide you the opportunity to consent to Bing Ads.
    *   **Facebook Ads.** Using [Facebook Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) , we may display interest-based ads to you when using Facebook. To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) in addition to the Your Choices section below. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our site, and Facebook matches the hashed data against its own users, generating a lookalike audience and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the “lookalike” audience, unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.
*   **F.** _Other Tracking Technologies_ . We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.
*   Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
*   **G.** _Do Not Track_ . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Site does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.
*   **H.** _Location Information_ . You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

In addition, most web browsers provide help pages relating to setting cookie preferences. More information may be found for the following browsers here: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB) , [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/260971/description-of-cookies) , [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer) , [Safari (Desktop)](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac) , [Safari (Mobile)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265) , [Android Browser](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/54068?visit_id=637188034605491433-3067478416&hl=en&rd=1) , [Opera Mobile](https://help.opera.com/en/mobile/android/) .

*   **C.** _Web Pixels_ . To see how successful our marketing campaigns or other goals of the Services are performing we sometimes use conversion pixels, which fire a short line of code to tell us when you have clicked on a particular button or reached a particular page (e.g. a thank you page once you have completed the procedure for subscribing to one of our services or have completed one of our forms). We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
*   **D.** _Analytics_ . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services. Presently, we use **Google Analytics** . Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports Site traffic. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) . Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) .
*   If Google Analytics is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Site will provide you the opportunity to consent to Google Analytics and the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. We have implemented Google Analytics with the “AnonymizeIP” function, which makes sure that your IP address will be shortened before it is sent to servers in the U.S. Exceptionally, the shortening may take place after such transfer to the U.S. Google uses this data to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on activities on our online services and to provide us with other services related to Site, App and internet use.
*   **E.** _Behavioral Remarketing_ . We also use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites to you after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services, e.g., by the duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the Google advertising network.
*   We use the following tools and services for these purposes:
*   *   **Google Ads** remarketing service is provided by Google. You can opt-out of this by visiting the Google Ads Settings page: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) .
    *   If Google Ads is structured to collect personal data, the data controller will be Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
    *   **Bing Ads** is a service operated by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland. Please read Microsoft’s privacy statement for more information on how Microsoft processes your information [https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/) . When you access our Site via advertisements on Bing Ads, a cookie is set on your computer. In addition, a Universal Event Tracking tag is integrated on our Site. This is a code that, in combination with the cookie, stores data about the use of the Site, e.g. length of time spent on the Site, areas accessed, and ads used to reach the Site. In addition, Microsoft may track your usage patterns across multiple of your electronic devices through so-called cross-device tracking. The information collected is transferred to a Microsoft server in the United States. If Bing Ads is structured to collect personal data, the cookie banner on our Services will provide you the opportunity to consent to Bing Ads.
    *   **Facebook Ads.** Using [Facebook Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) , we may display interest-based ads to you when using Facebook. To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) in addition to the Your Choices section below. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our site, and Facebook matches the hashed data against its own users, generating a lookalike audience and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the “lookalike” audience, unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.
*   **F.** _Other Tracking Technologies_ . We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.
*   Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
*   **G.** _Do Not Track_ . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Site does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.
*   **H.** _Location Information_ . You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

We may use cookies, tags, web pixels, and similar technologies to automatically collect information on our Services. Cookies or tags are bits of code that allow our technology partners to collect information that usually does not directly identify you. If required by law, we will request your consent before using cookies or other tracking technologies. Information within this section describes our use of cookies and your ability to control the use of cookies for advertising-related purposes. As described below, we will not use cookies or similar tracking technologies that process your personal data, unless they are Strictly Necessary Cookies, or you opt-in, i.e. consent, by using the cookie banner or consent manager found on our Site. You may withdraw your consent or update your preferences at any time by clicking the “Manage Cookies” link within the website footer.
